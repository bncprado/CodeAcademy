""""
Letâ€™s start by creating a function which both prints and returns values. For this function, we are going to print out the first three multiples of a number and return the third multiple. This means that we are going to print 1, 2, and 3 times the input number and then return the value of 3 times the input number. For this, we are going to need a few steps:

1. Define the function header to accept one input parameter called num
2. Print out 1 times num
3. Print out 2 times num
4. Print out 3 times num
5. Return the value of 3 times num

Coding question

Write a function named first_three_multiples() that has one parameter named num.

This function should print the first three multiples of num. Then, it should return the third multiple.

For example, first_three_multiples(7) should print 7, 14, and 21 on three different lines, and return 21.
"""
# Write your first_three_multiples function here
def first_three_multiples(num):
  print(1*num)
  print(2*num)
  print(3*num)
  return num*3


# Uncomment these function calls to test your first_three_multiples function:
first_three_multiples(10)
# should print 10, 20, 30, and return 30
first_three_multiples(0)
# should print 0, 0, 0, and return 0
