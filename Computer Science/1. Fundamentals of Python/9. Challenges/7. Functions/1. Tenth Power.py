""""
Let’s create some functions which can help us solve math problems! For this first function, we are going to take the tenth power of a number. In order to do this we need to do three things:

1. Set up the function header for tenth_power which accepts one parameter
2. Take the tenth power of the input value
3. Return the result

Coding question

Write a function named tenth_power() that has one parameter named num.

The function should return num raised to the 10th power.
"""
# Write your tenth_power function here:
def tenth_power(num): #same solution as codecademy
  return num ** 10

# Uncomment these function calls to test your tenth_power function:
print(tenth_power(1))
# 1 to the 10th power is 1
print(tenth_power(0))
# 0 to the 10th power is 0
print(tenth_power(2))
# 2 to the 10th power is 1024
