Another useful function for solving math problems is the square root function. We can create this using similar steps from the last problem. The code will look very similar. We need to:

1. Set up the function header for square_root which accepts one parameter
2. Take the square root of the input value
3. Return the result

Coding question

Write a function named square_root() that has one parameter named num.

Use exponents (**) to return the square root of num.
"""
# Write your square_root function here:
def square_root(num):
  return num ** 0.5

# Uncomment these function calls to test your square_root function:
print(square_root(16))
# should print 4
print(square_root(100))
# should print 10
