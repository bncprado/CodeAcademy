1. We here at The Boredless Tourist believe that mistakes should be easily corrected, so we keep all of our code version controlled using git.
Start by running git init in the terminal.

2. We'll be doing most of our coding in "2. The Boredless Tourist.py" so we want to make sure that we are tracking that in git.
Add it to git's staging area.
