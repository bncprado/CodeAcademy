1. We here at The Boredless Tourist believe that mistakes should be easily corrected, so we keep all of our code version controlled using git.

Start by running git init in the terminal.

2. We'll be doing most of our coding in script.py so we want to make sure that we are tracking that in git.

Add script.py to git's staging area.
