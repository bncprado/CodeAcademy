This lesson at codecademy consists in:

1. Learning some terminal commands like ls, pwd, mkdir, touch, cd, etc, and navigate through directories and files.
- pwd, to show in which folder we are at the moment
- ls, to show the files in the current folder.  
- mkdir to create a new folder inside the current folder
- "cd .." to exit the current folder or "cd folder name" to access the named folder. 
- touch namefile.extension to create a new file in the current folder
- we can use the "/" to access folders inside folders, for instance "cd folder1/folder1.1" goes straight to the "folder1.1", that is a folder inside "folder1"  
- we can use ".." to exit the current folder, or we can use "cd ../.." to exit two folders up. For instance, if we are inside folder 1.1.1 and want to go back to folder 1, we use "cd ../.."
- still in the folder domain, we can use "cd ../../folder2" to go two steps up and access other folder

2. Learning how to install and run python from the terminal, using the commands we learned to navigate through the folders 
- basically, the same as using VSCode.Something that I'm familiar with already

3. Write a simple txt and git it from the terminal, using git add, git status, git log, git commit, etc
- "git init" creates a new Git repository
- "git status" inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
- "git add" adds from the working directory to the staging area
- "git diff" shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
- "git commit" permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
- "git log" shows a list of all previous commits
