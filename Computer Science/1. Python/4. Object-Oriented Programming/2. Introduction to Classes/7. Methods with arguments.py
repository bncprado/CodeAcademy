1. It’s March 14th (known in some places as Pi day) at Jan van High, and you’re feeling awfully festive. You decide to create a program that calculates the area of a circle.

Create a Circle class with class variable .pi. Set .pi to the approximation 3.14.

2. Give Circle an .area() method that takes two parameters: self and radius.

Return the area as given by this formula:
area = pi * radius ** 2
"""

class Circle:
  pi = 3.14

  def area(self,radius):
    return self.pi * radius ** 2
    
""""
3. Create an instance of Circle. Save it into the variable circle.
"""

circle = Circle()

""""
4. You go to measure several circles you happen to find around.
- A medium pizza that is 12 inches across.
- Your teaching table which is 36 inches across.
- The Round Room auditorium, which is 11,460 inches across.

You save the areas of these three things into pizza_area, teaching_table_area, and round_room_area.

Remember that the .radius of a circle is half the diameter. We gave three diameters here, so halve them before you calculate the given circle’s area.
"""

pizza_area = circle.area(12/2)
teaching_table_area = circle.area(36/2)
round_room_area = circle.area(11460/2)
