1. You're a programmer working for an organization that is trying to digitize and store poetry called Preserve the Verse.

You've been given two strings, the title of a poem and its author, and have been asked to reformat them slightly to fit the conventions of the organization's database.

Make poem_title have title case and save it to poem_title_fixed.

2. Print poem_title and poem_title_fixed.

How did the string change?
"""
poem_title = "spring storm"
poem_author = "William Carlos Williams"
poem_title_fixed = poem_title.title()

print(poem_title)
print(poem_title_fixed)

""""
3. The organization’s database also needs the author’s name to be uppercase only.

Make poem_author uppercase and save it to poem_author_fixed.

4. Print poem_author and poem_author_fixed.

Again, how did the string change?
"""

poem_author_fixed = poem_author.upper()

print(poem_author_fixed)
