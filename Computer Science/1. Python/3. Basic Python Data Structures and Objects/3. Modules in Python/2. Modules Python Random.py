1. In script.py import the random library.

2. Create a variable random_list and set it equal to an empty list

3. Turn the empty list into a list comprehension that uses random.randint() to generate a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) for each number in range(101).

4. Create a new variable randomer_number and set it equal to random.choice() with random_list as an argument.

5. Print randomer_number out to see what number was picked!
