1. In your workspace, we’ve put a dictionary called data_payload. We want to save this to a file called data.json.

Let’s start by importing the json library.

2. Open a new file object in the variable data_json. The filename should be 'data.json' and the file should be opened in write-mode.

3. Call json.dump() with data_payload and data_json to convert our data to JSON and then save it to the file data.json.
